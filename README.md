This is a simple platformer game I made trying out the Flame engine.

The game is deployed [here](https://keyrunner-h32y2y3.web.app/)

## To run locally

Clone the repository and in the root directory run:

```
flutter run
```

## Instructions

The goal of the game is to complete levels by passing obstacles and collecting keys.

Movement in the game is simple, the ball jumps with a left-click or a tap.
